## Method
1. Mix together the Flour, Baking Soda, Baking Powder, and Salt.
2. In another bowl whip together the Brown Sugar, Granulated Sugar, and
Semi Melted Butter. The butter should be about half melted/half soft
but not hot.
3. Once sugars and butter have been creamed together add in the Eggs and the Vanilla Extract and mix until fully combined. 
4. Using a rubber spatula fold in the flour mixture. 
5. Fold in the chocolate chips.
6. Scoop about 2 tbsp of dough per cookie onto a parchment lined baking sheet and bake for 10-12 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven.

## Notes 
- Dough should not be chilled before baking, baking right after mixing will give best results!
